# Hormones Allow Farmers to Meet Consumer Demands
  this is a persuasive document and educational...get the audience to understand that organic raised food and conventional raised is all equally healthy... Audience is nutritionalist, people who are unware of the differences, and animal activists. 

## Introduction

Health is a constant study in today's society. Health has become a highly debated and discussed topic because of an increase in human obesity. What people eat, what exercises are the best, and what is the latest dieting techniques are several of the constant ways people try to stay "healthy." What does healthy mean? Based on the Oxford dictionary healthy is defined as a body with none diseased cells, of healthy size, and fit. In order to stay healthy the number one focus is what humans consume. One of the leading controversies today within the food industry are the additives in the food. For example, hormones in meats has been a widely debated topic for years. However, despite the arguments of artificial hormones added to meats in order to increase growth have been greatly exaggerated. Based on the standards of the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, foods have multiple regulations that must be passed in order for the products to make it from the farm to the grocery store. No artificial hormones are added to animals that are harmful for human consumption. The only hormones added are the natural hormones that already exist within the animals that assist in growth progress (FDA, 2017). Throughout my following posts I will discuss different types of food such as meats, dairy, and produce to prove that the process of foods at the farm level are in the best interest of the consumer.

## Hormones in Beef Cattle

Meat is the main source of protein humans can consume. The main meats consumed are chicken, beef, and pork. As humans have become more aware of the food they intake, meats are either avoided or the way in which they are raised is viewed as inhumane or harmful to human consumption. As previously stated in the introductory post, no artifical hormones are injected into the meats. There are natural hormones fed/njected into the animals which allow for them to grow more and without being harmful to humans. The main hormone in beef is estrogen. In a three ounce serving there is 1.2 nanograms in an hormone injected steer compared to a non-injected steer at 0.85 nanograms. Each choice of beef is healthy for human consumption. The amount of protein in a grass fed steer versus a grain fed steer is 21.8 grams to 22.6 grams (Beef it's Whats for Dinner). Therefore, despite what beef product chosen to eat is not harmful. Unlike beef that can be injected with natural hormones, chickens are not injected or fed any type of hormones. The reason for the increased size of chickens from the mid 1950s to today is the environment in which the chickens are raised. With the ability to better care for the chickens allows for their growth rate to increase. In the chicken houses the temperature is one way to regulate the growth. During the middle of winter, the chicken houses are able to be kept at warm temperatures to not affect the chickens. Also, the housing is able to allow the owners to feed with more consistent times. With just these two conditions, temperature and regulated feeding, the growth of the chicken is able to increase (The Truth About Hormone Free Chickens). Thus, making it from hatching to processing a quicker and easier process. Just like chicken, pork is prohibited to have hormones injected by USDA regulations (FSIS-USDA). Therefore, the three main meats consumed are all raised in a safe and healthy environment for humans. In 2017, statistics show that 25.8 kilograms per captia of beef, 48.8 kilograms per captia of poultry, and 23.6 kilograms per captia of pork was consumed (OECD). Therefore, meats are still highly consumed by humans and have no harmful effects.


## Hormones in Dairy Cattle

Drink milk to have strong bones.  This is a saying most children will hear while growing up to ensure they are healthy.  Although milk is very healthy, what exactly is the process of milk?  What does it go through to get from the cow to the refrigerator?  Unlike processing meats, milk goes through a more delicate process to make sure it is healthy for human consumption.  The most common breed of cattle used for milking is the Holstein cow.  They produce the most milk while preparing to calve.  They must be milked twice a day so the udders do not become too full that then would result in reduced milk production and possible mastitis.  Mastitis is an infection in which the udder becomes too full of milk and it is not removed.  This causes a fever, sensitivity, and thicker milk.  One way that can help is by keeping a regular milking schedule and stretching out the length the cow produces milk.  One hormone provided to the cows is called bovine somatotropin, or BST, which causes a cow to produce milk for a longer amount of time after calving (FDA, 2018).  With proper vitamins and supplements given to the cows the milk can be monitored that is in the best interest of the cow and milk.
